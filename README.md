# How to run the code

## Pre-requisites

As a pre-requisite you only need to have R installed. This is because once the code is executed the necessary libraries will be installed automatically. However, if you want to installed them before hand you can run the script `requirements.R` with the following command.

 > `Rscript requirements.R`

 You can run it manually from RStudio too if you have it installed it.

## Structure of the folder

```
IS-NLP
│   README.md
│   requirements.R    
│   helper.R    
│   IS-NLP-CarlosMoroteGarcia.Rmd    
│
└───data
    │   train.csv
    │   test.csv
```

## Steps to run the script
 1. Create the file and folder structure as described in the previous section.
 2. Run the R Notebook throw RStudio. (No further enviroment is required)
